## My Scripts
Scripts that I code in my free time for fun.

Languages:
* Python
* Bash
* Javascript

### Run them
If you want to use my scripts, you can download one of them or you can clone the whole repo.

You can do it using this in your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/akhilnarang/scripts
cd scripts
python folder/<name of script>.py
```
This case shows you how to execute a python script. If it were bash you can use:
```bash
bash folder/<name of script>.sh
```
And if it were javascript you can use Node or another console. I recommend node. Install it and use:
```bash
node folder/<name of script>.js
```

### Contributing
